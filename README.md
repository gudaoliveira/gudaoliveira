I'm a technology enthusiast and a passionate video game player, with a strong interest in automation of boring processes and the most important of all, Data Analysis❤️.

Currently, I'm working as a Business Intelligence Intern at a marketing agency, where I'm responsible for <b><u>Creating marketing reports and Analyzing project KPIs</u></b> and for that i use on a everyday basis:

    🔸 SQL
    🔸 Google Big Query
    🔸 Google Sheets
    🔸 Looker Studio

And for when i need to automate something in our workflow i often use 🐍Python and ☕Javascript on Google Apps Script
